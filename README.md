## Getting Started

Create an empty Vue on Rails project by running with an application template:

```
rails new app -m http://vueonrails.com/vue -d postgresql
```

To browse the application template, it's here http://vueonrails.com/vue

## Manual Installation

Create a Rails app with vue and webpack support.

```
rails new app --webpack=vue -d postgresql
```

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and run `bundle`

```ruby
gem 'vueonrails'
```

and run `rails vue:setup` to complete the installation

You can scaffold a Vue component by reading along the [Vue on Rails Handbook](/docs)
