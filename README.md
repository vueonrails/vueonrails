# Welcome to Vue on Rails Gem 💎

> Vue for your favourite Ruby on Rails projects

The Vue on Rails gem makes it easy to build your Rails with Vue components. 

It ships out-of-the-box configuration, component generators and solutions to make life easy for both Vue and Rails. 

---

## Getting Started

Create an empty Vue on Rails project by running with an application template: 

```
rails new app -m http://vueonrails.com/vue
```

To browse the application template, it's here http://vueonrails.com/vue 


## Manual Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and run `bundle`

```ruby
gem 'vueonrails'
```

and run `rails vue:setup`

You can scaffold a Vue component by reading along the [Vue on Rails Handbook](/docs)
